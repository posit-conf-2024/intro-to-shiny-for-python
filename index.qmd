## Introduction

This is the  website for the "Intro to Shiny for Python" workshop.

While most of these materials are designed to be used in conjunction with the workshop, they also stand alone as an educational resource.

## Background

This workshop is aimed at people who are somewhat familiar with doing data analysis in Python, but do not have much of a background in Shiny. 

If you are brand new to Python we recommend spending a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the following topics before the workshop: 

- How to install Python packages in a virtual environment 
- How to do basic data manipulation with `pandas` or `polars`
- How to draw plots 
- How to clone a repository with git
