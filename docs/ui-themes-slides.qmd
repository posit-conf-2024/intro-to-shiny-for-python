::: {.callout-tip}
As a webpage, a Shiny app is infinitely customizable in theory, but it may require CSS.

In this section, we will cover built in shortcuts and best practices.

# Themes

## Shinyswatch

Shinyswatch themes are the easiest way to change the entire look of an app.

![](images/shinyswatch.png){height=600 fig-align="center"}

::: aside
<https://posit-dev.github.io/py-shinyswatch/>
:::

## `theme`

Shinyswatch provides 25 bootstrap themes. Apply by name with the `theme` submodule.

```python
from shiny.express import input, render, ui
from shinyswatch import theme

ui.page_opts(
    theme = theme.superhero
)

# rest of app
```

## Your Turn

{{< yourturn 'express-307-themes' >}}

# Plots

## But what about plots?

And other elements that use colors, which may not match the theme?  
\
Each theme assigns its own set of color classes to predefined names. These are available in the themes `color` submodule. Set colors to these, e.g.  
\
```python
from shinywidgets import theme

app_theme = theme.superhero

ui.page_opts(
    theme = app_theme
)

ax.hist(x, input.n(), density=True, color=app_theme.colors.primary)
```

## 

::: {.callout-tip}
Use tab completion to explore the color options.

## Your Turn

{{< yourturn 'express-308-plot-themes' >}}

# Value boxes

## What about value boxes?

::: {.callout-tip}
To ensure a value box always matches the theme, directly set its `theme` to one of the recognized color names:

```python
with ui.value_box(theme = "primary"):
```
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
- primary
- primary-subtle
- secondary
- secondary-subtle
- success
- success-subtle
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
- danger
- danger-subtle
- warning
- warning-subtle
- info
- info-subtle
:::
::: {.column width="33%"}
- light
- light-subtle
- dark
- dark-subtle
:::

## Your Turn

{{< yourturn 'express-309-valuebox-themes' >}}

## That's it

That's the Pareto Rule for styling Shiny apps.  
\
But what if you want more control?

# CSS

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a framework for customizing the appearance of a webpage.

![](images/css.png){height=700 fig-align="center"}

## CSS in 30 seconds

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Define styles in one of three places:

1. Externally in a linked CSS file
2. Globally in a webpage's header
3. Locally in a tag's style attribute

:::
::: {.column}
Assign styles to:

1. Tags
2. Classes
3. id's
:::
::: 

## Adding CSS to a Shiny app

{{< yourview '335-css' >}}

## To link an external style sheet

Use `ui.include_css()` 

```python
from pathlib import Path

ui.include_css(
  Path(__file__.parent / "my-styles.css")
)
```

## To add CSS globally

Use `ui.tags.style()`

```python
ui.tags.style(
  ".card-header { color:white; background:#2A2A2A !important; }"
)
```

## To add CSS locally to a specifc element

Use the `style=` parameter.

```python
ui.card_header(
  "Title", 
  style = "white; background:#2A2A2A !important;"
)
```

## Bootstrap classes

::: {.callout-tip}
Bootstrap provides many predefined CSS classes. These are collections or coordinated style rules, ready to use pass to an element's `class_` parameter.

```python
ui.card_header("Title", class_="bg-secondary-subtle"):
```
:::

::: aside
See <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/background/> to begin your search for bootstrap class names.

## Your Turn

{{< yourturn 'express-310-element-themes' >}}

# Fonts

## Best Practice

::: {.callout-important}
If you use a non-standard font in your app, provide the font to your user's browser. 
::: 
\
There are two methods.

## 1. Import the font file from a service like Google Fonts

```python
ui.tags.link(
    rel="stylesheet",
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto"
)
```

## 2. Include the files with your app

::: {.callout-important}
This is the required method if your app will be viewed offline.
:::

## Quiz {background-color=`{python} bgcolor`}

Do any of our R for Shiny users know where to store files to share with the user's browser?

# www

## Who gets what?

The files in your app dorectory are shared with the computer that serves your app (so it can do its job), but not with your user's web browser.

::: {.callout-note}
To share files with the web browser you must place them in a sub-directory named `www`.
:::

## 

::: {.callout-note}
If you include a sub-directory named `www`, Shiny will make its contents available to the the application's UI at `/`.
:::

This makes `www` a very good place to store things needed by a browser, like:  

- CSS style sheets
- Images
- Fonts
